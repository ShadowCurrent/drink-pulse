## 2026-05-20 10:45 — plan-0017: test coverage to ≥90% + 6 bug fixes

### What changed

**Phase A — Bug fixes (4 production fixes, 2 coverage-only):**
- SB-1: `DashboardViewModel.guidelineDisplayName` was hardcoding English acronyms
  ("WHO", "DHS", "NHS", "NIAAA"). Now delegates to `GuidelineChoice.displayName`
  which uses `String(localized:)`. Confirmed broken in Polish locale by a failing
  test before the fix.
- SB-2: `.custom` guideline with `weeklyGoalGrams == 0` produced a zero denominator,
  making `weeklyPct = 0` and `riskLevel = .safe` regardless of consumption.
  Fixed by clamping `max(weeklyGoalGrams, 1.0)` in `DashboardViewModel.limits`.
- SB-3: `GuidelineStep.onboardingName` had `.who: "WHO"` hardcoded; other cases
  used `String(localized:)`. One-liner fix.
- SB-4: `DrinkTypePreset.preset(for:)` used `first{} ?? .custom` — the fallback was
  unreachable but hid future category additions. Replaced with exhaustive switch.
- SB-5/SB-6: No production fixes; added tests for `formattedAlcohol`, `formattedSpend`,
  `todaySpend`, `todayDrinkCount` (coverage-only).

**Phase B+D — New test files:**
- `GuidelineChoiceDisplayTests.swift` — `displayName` + `thresholdSummary`
- `AlcoholUnitTests.swift` — `unitLabel` + `displayName` on `AlcoholUnit`
- `DrinkTemplateTests.swift` — SwiftData init round-trip

**Test infrastructure:**
- `DashboardViewModelTests.swift` split from 324 lines into 3 files:
  main + `+Metrics.swift` + `+Formatting.swift`. All under 200 lines.
- Test count: 73 → 121 tests.

### Coverage results (testable code)

| Layer | Before | After | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain | ~64% | ~100% | 100% |
| DashboardViewModel | 71% | 98% | ≥90% |
| OnboardingViewModel | 90% | 100% | ≥90% |
| DrinkTypePreset | 63% | 91% | ≥90% |
| UserProfile | 65% | 91% | 100% (excl. preview helper) |

### Key decisions

- `max(weeklyGoalGrams, 1.0)` as inline literal; named constant would add
  ceremony without clarity (noted in execution log as resolved open question).
- `DashboardViewModelTests` split into 3 files rather than 2: main (streaks/risk/bars),
  +Metrics (counts/spend/limits), +Formatting (display/greeting/formatting).
- `GuidelineChoiceDisplayTests` marked `@MainActor` because `displayName` is
  inferred as main-actor-isolated (defined in a file that imports SwiftUI).

### Open questions

None new. SB-5 confirmed as a testing gap only (no behavioral bug in `formattedAlcohol`).

## 2026-05-20 06:15 — plan-0007: design system primitives completed

### What changed (visual QA + AX5 fix)

Visual QA via Previews:
- Light mode: glass cards and arc gauge render correctly.
- Dark mode: ultraThinMaterial fallback produces correct dark charcoal cards.
- AX5: found critical regression — `HStack` rows stacked characters vertically. Fixed with `SettingsRow<Content>` (private struct in SettingsView) that checks `dynamicTypeSize.isAccessibilitySize` and switches to `VStack(alignment: .leading)`. Also fixed guideline disclosure row with inline `typeSize` conditional in `SettingsForm`.

**Also committed:** AX5 fix for `guidelineCard` using `@Environment(\.dynamicTypeSize)` on `SettingsForm`.

**Status:** plan-0007 completed. 73 tests passing.

---

## 2026-05-19 16:40 — plan-0007: design system primitives (in-progress)

### What changed

- **`DesignSystem/DPGlass.swift`** — `dpGlassCard(_:)` view modifier. `DPGlassSize` enum: `.chip` (r=16), `.card` (r=22), `.sheet` (r=28). On iOS 26+: `glassEffect(.regular, in: .rect(cornerRadius:))`. On iOS 18 fallback: `ultraThinMaterial` + white inset stroke + drop shadow (values differ for light vs dark).
- **`DesignSystem/DPSemanticColors.swift`** — `Color.dpRiskLow / .dpRiskModerate / .dpRiskHigh` via three new Asset Catalog colorsets (adaptive light/dark).
- **`DesignSystem/DPLargeTitle.swift`** — `dpLargeTitle()` modifier: `.system(size: 28, weight: .bold)` + `.kerning(-0.6)`.
- **`DesignSystem/DPArcProgress.swift`** — 240° arc gauge. `ArcShape` draws from 150° CCW-in-math (= CW on screen) for correct speedometer orientation. Accessibility label reads localized `arc.progress.label`.
- **`Domain/GuidelineChoice+Display.swift`** — `displayName` and `thresholdSummary(for:)` extracted from private extensions in SettingsView and GuidelineStep. Added to resolve duplication forced by the file-split.
- **`Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** — pilot adoption: `Form` replaced by `ScrollView + VStack` with `.dpGlassCard()` on each section. `GuidelinePickerSheet` extracted to `Components/` to keep file under 300 lines.
- **`Localizable.xcstrings`** — added `arc.progress.label` (en/de/pl).

### Key decisions

- Q1 (Form vs custom): custom cards — exact match to design handoff.
- Q2 (iOS 26 native vs hand-rolled): `#available(iOS 26, *)` conditional — native on 26+, material fallback on 18.
- Q3 (corner radii): design values (16/22/28).
- `GuidelineChoice+Display.swift` placed in `Domain/` rather than a feature subfolder because `displayName` + `thresholdSummary` are domain-display concerns shared by Settings and Onboarding.

### Status

Build clean, 73 tests passing. plan-0007 in-progress; visual QA (Previews light/dark/AX5) needed before closing.

## 2026-05-19 14:30 — plan-0009: onboarding flow shipped

### What changed

**Domain model** (`UserProfile.swift`):
- `ageYears: Int` (stored) replaced by `dateOfBirth: Date?` (stored) + `ageYears: Int?`
  (computed). Full DOB gives auto-updating age for future BAC/Widmark calculations.
- Breaking schema change: dev-only wipe fallback added to `drinkpulseApp.swift`.
  Must become a proper `SchemaMigrationPlan` before App Store submission.

**App routing** (`drinkpulseApp.swift`):
- `@AppStorage("dp_onboarding_done")` controls first-launch routing.
- Auto-insert of default `UserProfile` removed; onboarding owns profile creation.

**Settings** (`SettingsView.swift`):
- `TextField`+`onChange` for age replaced with `DatePicker` for `dateOfBirth`.

**Onboarding feature** (`Features/Onboarding/`):
- 5 new files: `OnboardingViewModel`, `OnboardingView`, `WelcomeStep`, `ProfileStep`,
  `GuidelineStep`.
- Step container: `TabView(.page)` with dot indicator; reduces-motion aware.
- Profile step: segmented sex picker + DatePicker + "Stored only on this device" privacy note.
- Guideline step: WHO/DE/UK/US list with live g/day · g/week thresholds.
- Skip semantics: skip-all (no profile), skip step, skip guideline (WHO default).

**Tests**: 8 new tests in `OnboardingViewModelTests.swift`; 73 total — all green.

### Key decisions

- `dateOfBirth: Date?` chosen over `birthYear: Int?` (accurate for BAC, full DOB doesn't
  leave device). Per owner decision mid-session.
- `TabView(.page)` used as default (plan Q1 option A) — native swipe, standard iOS feel.
- `guidelineExplicitlyPicked` flag prevents inserting a profile when user only touched
  the guideline screen without changing from WHO default.
- Test container lifetime: `makeContext()` returning orphaned context caused SwiftData
  `brk 1` trap; fixed by using `makeContainer()` pattern (matches existing tests).

### Living docs touched

- `docs/roadmap.md` — plan-0009 🗓 → 🔄.
- `docs/plans/INDEX.md` — plan-0009 `draft` → `in-progress`.
- `.claude/context/open-questions.md` — added SwiftData migration plan item.
- `docs/plans/0009-onboarding-flow/execution.md` — created.
- Localizable.xcstrings — 15 new onboarding keys + `settings.age` → `settings.dateOfBirth`.

### Open for next session

- plan-0009 stays in-progress (no retrospective yet — plan may need further work).
- SwiftData migration plan needed before shipping (see open-questions.md).

## 2026-05-19 13:40 — plan-0015: risk language rename completed

### What changed

- Updated `drinkpulse/Localizable.xcstrings` — three keys, all three locales (en / de / pl):
  - `dashboard.risk.safe`:     "On track" → "Low Risk" / "Im Rahmen" → "Geringes Risiko" / "W normie" → "Niskie ryzyko"
  - `dashboard.risk.caution`:  "Watch out" → "Moderate Risk" / "Aufpassen" → "Mittleres Risiko" / "Uważaj" → "Umiarkowane ryzyko"
  - `dashboard.risk.exceeded`: "Over limit" → "High Risk" / "Limit überschritten" → "Hohes Risiko" / "Powyżej normy" → "Wysokie ryzyko"

### Key decisions

- Title-case used ("Low Risk", not "Low risk") — matches design handoff; open question resolved with default.
- Enum case names (`.safe`, `.caution`, `.exceeded`) left unchanged per plan — internal API churn with no user benefit.
- The plan listed outdated string values ("Safe / Caution / Exceeded") that did not match the live file ("On track / Watch out / Over limit"). Actual values replaced; discrepancy noted in execution.md.

### Build / tests

Build clean, 0 errors. No Swift files over 300 lines. No unit tests needed (string-only).

### Living docs touched

- `docs/roadmap.md` — plan-0015 flipped 🗓 → ✅.
- `docs/plans/INDEX.md` — plan-0015 status `draft` → `completed`.
- `docs/plans/0015-risk-language-rename/execution.md` — created.
- `docs/plans/0015-risk-language-rename/retrospective.md` — created.

## 2026-05-19 13:15 — Claude Design handoff: 10 draft plans landed

### What changed

No code touched. A Claude Design HTML/CSS prototype bundle for an iOS 26
Liquid Glass refresh of DrinkPulse arrived; carved its content into ten
focused, draft plans so each piece can move independently once Open
questions are answered.

New plans (all `draft`):

| #    | Title                                                         | Size   |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 0007 | Design system: iOS 26 Liquid Glass primitives                 | medium |
| 0008 | Theme palettes: Ember / Forest / Iris                         | medium |
| 0009 | Onboarding flow (3 steps, skippable)                          | medium |
| 0010 | Floating tab bar with prominent Add-Drink FAB                 | medium |
| 0011 | Dashboard arc-progress hero + chip refactor                   | medium |
| 0012 | Insights screen                                               | large  |
| 0013 | History calendar with clickable days                          | medium |
| 0014 | Edit entry: custom name, notes, category change               | medium |
| 0015 | Risk language rename ("Safe" → "Low Risk")                    | small  |
| 0016 | Log-reminder local notifications                              | medium |

### Key decisions (captured inside the plans)

- Each plan starts as `draft` with explicit Open questions so the owner
  picks before any plan flips to `in-progress`.
- Plan 0001 (Dashboard Redesign) stays `in-progress`; the visual upgrade
  it scoped is being split into plans 0007/0008/0010/0011/0015. A
  cross-reference entry was appended to `0001/execution.md`.
- "Safe" risk wording is being removed everywhere — alcohol intake is
  never medically "safe" (owner-stated). Plan 0015 owns the rename.
- The Add Drink button moves to a 54pt FAB on the floating tab bar
  (visibility was a stated pain point). Toolbar `+` buttons go away in
  plan 0010.
- Theme palettes (Ember / Forest / Iris) become a brand-level choice in
  Settings; semantic accent colours (`dpTeal`, `dpAmber`, etc.) stay for
  domain-meaning use cases (risk, drink count).
- Onboarding adds **no required fields** — every step skippable; default
  guideline is WHO; default theme is Ember; appearance follows system.
- BAC estimator stays deferred. Apple Watch glance, widget, AI chat,
  PDF export of Insights stay as roadmap ideas — no plans yet.

### Living docs touched

- `docs/plans/INDEX.md` — added 10 rows; next number 0017.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — new "Medium-term (design handoff)" block linking
  plans; future ideas list extended (AI chat, PDF export, watch, widget).
- `docs/product.md` — Future section split into Planned (with plan links)
  vs longer-term Future.
- `README.md` — minimum deployment iOS 17 → iOS 18 (stale since plan 0006).
- `.claude/context/current-focus.md` — overwritten with this session's
  state and next-session candidates.
- `.claude/context/open-questions.md` — calendar-thresholds question
  cross-referenced into plan 0013.

### Memory saved (for future sessions)

`memory/`:
- `reference_claude_design_handoff.md` — pointer to the design bundle.
- `project_future_ai_chat.md`, `project_future_pdf_export_insights.md`,
  `project_future_apple_watch.md`, `project_future_widget.md`,
  `project_future_rerun_onboarding.md`.
- `feedback_risk_language.md`, `feedback_add_drink_prominence.md`.
- `user_role_and_app.md`.

### Build / tests

Not run — doc-only session.

### Open / next steps

Owner reviews the 10 draft plans, answers Open questions in each,
then we flip plans to `in-progress` in dependency order (recommended
sequence in `current-focus.md`).

## 2026-05-18 — Raise deployment target to iOS 18 [plan-0006]

### What changed

- **`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`** — 17.0 → 18.0 in all 4 build configurations.
- **`ContentView.swift`** — restored `Tab {}` syntax (iOS 18); removed all biometric
  lock wiring (`AppLockState`, scenePhase observer, lock overlay, `didApplyInitialLock`).
- **`drinkpulseApp.swift`** — removed `AppLockState` creation and `.environment` injection.
- **`Features/Lock/`** — folder deleted: `AppLockState.swift`, `LockScreenView.swift`.
- **`Domain/BiometricService.swift`** — deleted.
- **`drinkpulseTests/BiometricServiceTests.swift`** — deleted; deregistered from `project.pbxproj`.
- **`Domain/UserProfile.swift`** — removed `appLockEnabled: Bool` field. SwiftData
  lightweight migration handles orphaned column automatically; no user action required.
- **`Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** — Privacy & Security section now shows a
  tappable row that opens `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString` instead of a Toggle.
  `import LocalAuthentication` replaced with `import UIKit`.
- **`project.pbxproj`** — removed `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSFaceIDUsageDescription`.
- **`Localizable.xcstrings`** — removed 7 keys (`lock.*`, `settings.appLock*`);
  added `settings.systemLock` and `settings.systemLock.footer` (en/de/pl).
- **`CLAUDE.md`**, **`docs/product.md`** — minimum deployment updated to iOS 18.
- **`docs/roadmap.md`** — "Conditional on dropping iOS 17" renamed to "iOS 18+";
  biometric migration and Tab {} items marked ✅.

### Key decisions

- **Removal without migration alert**: app not yet published, zero existing users.
  No `didShowLockMigrationAlert` flag needed.
- **Deep link row instead of toggle**: system-managed feature belongs in iOS Settings,
  not the app. The row opens the correct page directly.
- **SwiftData `appLockEnabled` removal**: no migration code written. SwiftData's
  lightweight migration silently orphans the column; safe for live apps too.

### Results

Build clean, 65/65 tests green (2 tests removed with BiometricServiceTests), 0 errors.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Biometric app lock [plan-0005]

### What changed

- **`Domain/BiometricService.swift`** — new `struct BiometricService` (Sendable). Wraps `LAContext` with an injected factory closure for testability. Exposes `canAuthenticate: Bool` (checks `.deviceOwnerAuthentication` policy) and `authenticate(reason:) async throws`. `biometryType` property used by `LockScreenView` to pick the right SF Symbol at runtime.
- **`Features/Lock/AppLockState.swift`** — new `@Observable @MainActor final class AppLockState`. Single source of truth for transient lock state (`isLocked: Bool`). Injected app-wide via `.environment(lockState)`.
- **`Features/Lock/LockScreenView.swift`** — full-screen overlay. On `.onAppear` triggers biometric auth automatically. Shows app name, biometry icon (faceid / touchid / lock.fill), "Unlock" button, and "Authentication failed" error label on failure. Cancel and system-cancel do not set `authFailed`.
- **`Domain/UserProfile.swift`** — added `appLockEnabled: Bool = false`. SwiftData lightweight migration (new field with inline default — no schema version bump required).
- **`drinkpulseApp.swift`** — creates `@State private var lockState = AppLockState()` and injects it into environment.
- **`ContentView.swift`** — added `@Environment(AppLockState.self)`, `@Environment(\.scenePhase)`, and `@Query profiles`. On `.background` transition, locks if `appLockEnabled`. ZStack overlay shows `LockScreenView` with `.opacity` transition when `lockState.isLocked`.
- **`Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** — new "Privacy & Security" section with a `Toggle` bound to `profile.appLockEnabled`. Disabled with explanatory footer when `!biometricService.canAuthenticate` (device has no passcode).
- **`drinkpulse.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — added `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSFaceIDUsageDescription` to both Debug and Release build configurations.
- **`Localizable.xcstrings`** — 8 new keys (en / de / pl): `lock.authFailed`, `lock.authReason`, `lock.title`, `lock.unlock`, `settings.appLock`, `settings.appLock.footer`, `settings.appLock.footer.unavailable`, `settings.section.privacy`.
- **`drinkpulseTests/BiometricServiceTests.swift`** — 2 new tests: `canAuthenticate` returns false with a mock that always fails, true with a mock that always succeeds.

### Key decisions

- **Policy `deviceOwnerAuthentication`** (not `deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics`): biometrics first; on failure iOS automatically shows the device passcode UI — no custom PIN needed in the app. Matches the UX expectation described by the user.
- **Lock trigger on `.background`** (not on `.inactive`): `.inactive` fires during screenshot preview and system overlays, which would cause false locks. `.background` only fires when the app truly leaves screen.
- **Transient lock state in `AppLockState`** (not persisted in SwiftData): the persisted flag `appLockEnabled` says whether locking is wanted; the in-memory `isLocked` says whether the app is currently locked. They are separate concerns.
- **`BiometricService` with injected factory** — `LAContext` is a class; the factory closure lets tests substitute a mock without introducing a protocol. Keeps the service a simple value type.

### Results

Build clean, 65/65 tests green (2 new), 0 errors.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Living document audit and update

### What changed

- **`README.md`** — full rewrite to reflect built state: all four screens operational (Dashboard with charts and streak cards, History with edit, Settings with all five preference controls, Add Drink v2), iOS 17 minimum, Xcode 16, 63 unit tests, `Components/` subfolder in architecture diagram.
- **`docs/product.md`** — Settings user stories corrected: body weight and currency are not yet in Settings UI (fields exist in `UserProfile` for future BAC/spending features). Future section split: BAC now explicitly requires body weight input; currency and spending tracker moved there too. "Weekly and monthly trend charts" removed from Future (weekly bar chart is already shipped).
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — four contradictions fixed: (1) "DesignSystem (future)" → DesignSystem exists and is used; (2) MVVM+Repository section rewritten — no repository layer exists; views use `@Query` + `modelContext` directly; view models receive injected plain values; (3) Navigation section updated — only AddDrink uses value-based `NavigationLink(value:)`; other tabs use `NavigationStack` for the title bar only; (4) DI section: removed reference to repositories being injected via `@Entry` keys; clarified the actual usage.
- **`docs/domain.md`** — ConsumptionEvent entity description updated to list optional fields: `price` (captured in AddDrink), `notes` and `location` (scaffolded for future features, not yet in UI).
- **`docs/roadmap.md`** — two corrections: (a) "Dashboard overflow rings (> 100% shown as second arc)" removed — implementation uses progress bars, not rings; (b) "Swift Charts: weekly trend, daily breakdown" updated to "monthly trend, more advanced breakdown charts" since the weekly bar chart is already shipped in plan-0001.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added Documentation update model section (append-only / immutable-after-freeze / living documents classification with per-file update triggers); living docs audit added as step 2 of end-of-task checklist; Git push rules section added.

### Key decisions

- Fields that exist in the model but are not yet in the UI (bodyWeightKg, currency, notes, location) are described as "scaffolded for future features" rather than removed — they represent intentional forward-planning, not errors.
- Roadmap items whose implementation took a different shape than originally planned (rings → progress bars) are corrected rather than kept as historical record — the roadmap describes current reality, not design intent.

## 2026-05-18 — Dashboard redesign [plan-0001]

### What changed

- **`DesignSystem/DPColors.swift`** — new file with 5 fixed accent colours (`dpTeal`, `dpAmber`, `dpRed`, `dpPurple`, `dpGreen`) as `Color` extensions.
- **`Features/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift`** — new `@Observable @MainActor final class`. Inputs injected by the view (`events`, `profile`, `now`); all computed. Key properties: `todayGrams`, `todayCaloriesKcal`, `todayDrinkCount`, `todaySpend`, `weeklyGrams`, `weeklyPct`, `riskLevel`, `weekBarData` (Mon–Sun chart data), `currentStreakDays`, `soberDaysThisMonth`, `greetingText`. `weekStartsOnMonday: Bool` param added for future UserProfile wiring.
- **`Features/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift`** — full rewrite. Layout: greeting + `RiskBadge` header; `MetricCard` 2×2 grid (spend card hidden if no prices); `WeeklyGoalCard` with weekly ring + Swift Charts bar chart; two `StreakCard` blocks; `GuidelineAlertCard` shown only when limit exceeded.
- **`drinkpulseTests/DashboardViewModelTests.swift`** — 16 unit tests for all plan-required cases. Manually registered in `project.pbxproj` (test target uses explicit file refs).
- **`Localizable.xcstrings`** — 14 new keys (en/de/pl).

### Key decisions

- `weeklyGrams` uses current week interval (Mon–Sun) rather than rolling 7 days, so the ring and bar chart share the same domain. More coherent UX.
- Guideline alert card is non-tappable placeholder; user has a Figma design for the tap action (deferred).
- Currency uses `NumberFormatter.currencyCode` from `UserProfile.currency`. Multi-currency (per-drink currency field) deferred to a separate plan.
- `currentStreakDays` returns 0 when `events` is empty (loop would otherwise return 366+; no drink history = no meaningful streak).
- `UIColor.quinarySystemFill` does not exist; replaced with `quaternarySystemFill` for future bars in bar chart.

### Results

Build clean, 52/52 tests green (16 new), 0 warnings.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Dashboard consumption overview [plan-0003]

### What changed

- **`DashboardViewModel.swift`** — added `thirtyDayGrams`, `thirtyDayLimitGrams`, `effectiveDailyLimitGrams` (UK fallback: `weeklyLimitGrams / 7` when no daily limit), `formattedNumber(_:)` (number only, no unit label).
- **`DashboardView.swift`** — added `sectionLabel(_:)` uppercase header helper; `ConsumptionOverviewCard` with three `IntakePeriodRow` stacks (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days); `ThisWeekCard` (bar chart only); removed `WeeklyGoalCard` ring (made redundant by 7 Days progress bar).
- **`Localizable.xcstrings`** — 6 new keys: `dashboard.section.today`, `dashboard.section.thisWeek`, `dashboard.overview.title`, `dashboard.overview.days7`, `dashboard.overview.days30`, `dashboard.overview.overLimit` (en/de/pl).
- **`DashboardViewModelTests.swift`** — 4 new tests: `thirtyDayGrams` boundary (day 29 included, day 31 excluded); `effectiveDailyLimitGrams` with WHO (uses actual daily) and UK (falls back to weekly/7).

### Key decisions

- Consumption overview placed **below** the today metrics grid. The header `RiskBadge` already surfaces risk immediately; today cards are the primary action area; the overview is supporting context.
- `WeeklyGoalCard` ring removed — the "7 Days" progress bar in the overview is a direct replacement.
- All gram values converted via `alcoholUnit.formattedValue` so the display respects the user's unit preference (grams / UK units / standard drinks).
- UK guideline (`dailyGrams == 0`) — `effectiveDailyLimitGrams` falls back to `weeklyLimitGrams / 7` to keep the Today progress bar meaningful.

### Results

Build clean, 56/56 tests green (4 new), 0 errors.

## 2026-05-18 — Lower deployment target to iOS 17 [plan-0002]

### What changed
- `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` lowered from `26.5` to `17.0` across all four
  build configurations (app Debug/Release, tests Debug/Release).
- `ContentView.swift`: replaced iOS 18+ `Tab(title:systemImage:content:)` with
  the universally-supported `.tabItem { Label(...) }` pattern (iOS 16+).
- `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/product.md`, `docs/architecture.md`: updated minimum
  deployment references from iOS 26 to iOS 17.

### Key decision
Targeted iOS 17 (not iOS 18) to cover 2–3 major versions back. The only
iOS 18-specific API in the codebase was the new `Tab { }` initialiser; replacing
it with `.tabItem` is a no-cost mechanical change that also covers iOS 16.

### Results
Build clean, 36/36 tests green, 0 warnings.

---

## 2026-05-17 — Fix Swift 6 concurrency warnings

### What changed

- **`DrinkCategory` extracted to `Domain/DrinkCategory.swift`** — was co-located with `@Model class DrinkTemplate`, causing the SwiftData macro's `@MainActor` isolation to leak into `DrinkTypePreset` static properties via the `category: DrinkCategory` property chain.
- **`GuidelineChoice+Limits.swift` extracted** — `GuidelineLimits.swift` previously held both the struct and the `extension GuidelineChoice` block. The extension's connection to `@MainActor`-inferred `GuidelineChoice` was causing `GuidelineLimits.dailyGrams`/`weeklyGrams` to be inferred `@MainActor`. Now the struct lives alone in a file with no actor-isolated neighbours.
- **`nonisolated` added to `AlcoholUnit` extension members** (`formattedValue`, `unitLabel`, `displayName`) and `DrinkTypePreset.abvRange` — pure functions with no actor dependency, explicitly opted out of the `@MainActor` inference from the co-located `@Model` class.
- **`GuidelineChoice.limits(for:)` kept `nonisolated`** — now that the struct is separated, this annotation correctly documents that the function has no actor requirement.
- **`AlcoholCalculationTests` and `DrinkTypePresetTests` annotated `@MainActor`** — `AlcoholCalculationTests` constructs `ConsumptionEvent` (`@Model` = `@MainActor`); `DrinkTypePresetTests` accesses `DrinkTypePreset` static lets which are legitimately `@MainActor`-inferred. Adding `@MainActor` is honest and lets the `#expect` macro's autoclosures access isolated properties.

### Key decisions

- Chose per-file isolation over adding `nonisolated(unsafe)` to every static let. The file-split approach breaks the inference root and avoids the contradictory warning pair (compiler warns both "unnecessary" with `nonisolated(unsafe)` and "can't reference" without it on Sendable constants).
- Kept `DrinkCategory` as `Sendable` — still holds even after the move; `DrinkTypePreset.all`/`.custom` no longer warn after extraction.
- Build and test both clean: 0 warnings, 36/36 tests pass.

## 2026-05-17 — Project cleanup

### What changed

- **Removed `GuidelineProfile` SwiftData model** — the type was in the schema and referenced in every preview `ModelContainer`, but never queried or inserted anywhere in the app. All limit logic lives in `GuidelineLimits.swift` / `GuidelineChoice.limits(for:)`. Removed from schema, deleted `Domain/GuidelineProfile.swift`, and stripped `GuidelineProfile.self` from all 8 `#Preview` blocks.
- **Removed unused localization keys** — `dashboard.placeholder` (dashboard now shows rings, never the placeholder) and `history.units` (superseded by `unit.units` / `AlcoholUnit.unitLabel`).
- **Updated CLAUDE.md build destination** — `iPhone 16 Pro` → `iPhone 17 Pro` (16 Pro no longer in available simulators).

## 2026-05-17 — Edit ConsumptionEvent screen

### What changed

New `EditEventView` sheet opened by tapping any row in the history list. The form mirrors Add Drink (drum-roll pickers for volume / ABV / count, category picker, name field, date+time picker, price field, live alcohol readout). State is held in `@State` copies of the event's fields — changes are written to the `@Model` only on Save, Cancel is a no-op.

`DrinkTypePreset.preset(for:)` helper added so both `EditEventView` and future code can resolve a preset from a `DrinkCategory` without duplicating the lookup.

### Key decisions

- **Volume/count recovery**: the stored `volumeMl` is the product of serving size × count. On opening, a brute-force search over all (count 1–10) × (preset volumes) finds the pair that minimises the absolute difference. Recovers e.g. 1000 ml → 2 × 500 ml correctly.
- **ABV init without `@Query`**: ABV index is initialised with the default 0.5 % step size in `init` (where profile isn't accessible). `safeAbvIndex` clamps at runtime if the user's precision setting differs — same pattern as `DrinkDetailInputView`.
- **No auto-save**: `@Bindable` direct binding was rejected in favour of local `@State` to avoid partial edits leaking into the history list while the sheet is still open.
- **Date + time in edit**: Add Drink shows `.date` only; Edit shows `.date` and `.hourAndMinute` since correcting a log time is a common edit scenario.

## 2026-05-17 — Sex-aware guideline limits + alcohol density correction

### What changed

**Alcohol density constant**: changed from 0.789 g/ml (scientific ethanol density) to 0.8 g/ml (BZgA/European health authority convention). Gives exactly 20 g for 500 ml × 5% beer, consistent with German and other European health materials. Updated in `ConsumptionEvent.pureAlcoholGrams`, `DrinkDetailInputView`, and CLAUDE.md. UK units threshold updated accordingly: 10 ml × 0.8 = 8.0 g/unit (was 7.89 g).

**Sex-aware guideline limits**: added `GuidelineLimits` struct and `GuidelineChoice.limits(for: BiologicalSex)` in a new `Domain/GuidelineLimits.swift`. Dashboard rings and guideline picker sheet now use the user's biological sex to determine thresholds.

| Guideline | Men | Women |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| WHO | 20 g/day · 100 g/week | 10 g/day · 70 g/week |
| DE (DHS) | 24 g/day · 168 g/week | 12 g/day · 84 g/week |
| UK (NHS) | 112 g/week (no daily limit) | same |
| US (NIAAA) | 28 g/day · 196 g/week | 14 g/day · 98 g/week |

### Key decisions

- Density 0.8 vs 0.789: chose 0.8 because users will cross-reference results against health authority materials that use this convention. Scientific precision is secondary to consistency with the guidelines the app is built around.
- `thresholdSummary` in `GuidelinePickerSheet` is now derived from `GuidelineLimits` rather than hardcoded strings, so it stays in sync with the domain logic automatically.

---

## 2026-05-17 — Settings UI redesign

### What changed

Replaced the inline guideline Picker with a half-sheet (`GuidelinePickerSheet`) that displays each option with its name and threshold summary (e.g. "20 g/day · 100 g/week"). Presentation uses `.presentationDetents([.medium])` and `.presentationDragIndicator(.visible)`.

Changed age input from a `Stepper` to an integer `TextField` with `.keyboardType(.numberPad)`, clamped via `.onChange` to 13–120.

ABV precision now uses a standard inline Picker (no custom style), consistent with other preference rows.

### Key decision — guideline row tint

Using `Button` inside a `Form` automatically tints all label content with the accent color (blue), which was inconsistent with other rows like the sex Picker. Replaced with `HStack` + `.contentShape(Rectangle())` + `.onTapGesture` to preserve native row appearance without blue tint.

---

## 2026-05-16 10:00 — Bootstrap domain models and project structure

### What was built

**Domain models** (`Domain/`):
- `DrinkTemplate` — reusable drink preset (name, category, default volume, ABV as fraction 0.0–1.0, icon, colorHex, isFavorite, isArchived). Relationship to ConsumptionEvent with `.nullify` delete rule so deleting a template never cascades to history.
- `ConsumptionEvent` — single logged drink. Snapshots template fields (name/category/icon) at insert time so editing a template never alters history. Computed `pureAlcoholGrams = volumeMl * abv * 0.789`.
- `UserProfile` — SwiftData singleton enforced via `@Attribute(.unique) id = "singleton"`. Fields: bodyWeightKg, biologicalSex, ageYears, guidelineChoice, weeklyGoalGrams, unitSystem.
- `GuidelineProfile` — threshold model for WHO / DE / UK / US / custom. Static factory methods create insertable instances; seeding is the repository's responsibility.

**Key decision — ABV storage**: plain fraction (0.05 = 5%), NOT percentage. Formula: `volumeMl * abv * 0.789`. CLAUDE.md updated accordingly.

**Project structure**:
- `Features/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift` — root Home tab (stub + add button)
- `Features/History/HistoryView.swift` — stub
- `Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` — stub
- `Features/AddDrink/AddDrinkView.swift` — v1 form sheet (replaced in next session)
- `ContentView.swift` — root TabView (Home / History / Settings)
- `drinkpulseApp.swift` — ModelContainer with all four models

**Removed**: `Item.swift` (Xcode default template model)

### Rejected approaches
- `navigationTransitionSource/Destination` (iOS 26 zoom sheet transition) — API does not exist in the current SDK despite being listed in the swiftui-expert-skill reference. Fell back to standard `.sheet(isPresented:)`.

---

## 2026-05-16 13:30 — Add Drink v1: basic form sheet

### What was built
- `AddDrinkView` as a plain Form sheet with: name field, category Picker, volume TextField (ml), ABV TextField (%), optional notes.
- On Save: converts ABV% → fraction (`/ 100`), inserts `ConsumptionEvent` into modelContext.
- `DashboardView` toolbar trailing `+` button presents the sheet.

---

## 2026-05-16 14:00 — Add Drink v2: two-step flow with drum-roll pickers

### What was built

**Flow redesign**: replaced the plain form with a two-step modal:
1. **DrinkTypeGridView** — `LazyVGrid` of category tiles (icon + name). Cancel dismisses the sheet.
2. **DrinkDetailInputView** — three side-by-side `.wheel` pickers (volume | ABV% | count 1–10×), date picker (date only, default today), optional price field, live alcohol-units readout. Save dismisses the sheet.

**New files**:
- `Features/AddDrink/DrinkTypePreset.swift` — static drink type data (volumes, ABV range per category). Not stored in SwiftData — these are app-level defaults, not user data.
- `Features/AddDrink/DrinkTypeGridView.swift` — step 1 grid + `DrinkTypeTile` subview.
- `Features/AddDrink/DrinkDetailInputView.swift` — step 2 configuration screen.
- `AddDrinkView.swift` updated to be a `NavigationStack` wrapper; injects `dismissSheet` environment value so the pushed detail view can dismiss the whole sheet on save.

**Domain model additions** (all backward-compatible / migration-safe):
- `DrinkCategory`: added `.champagne`, `.cider` cases (String-backed Codable enum — existing records decode fine).
- `ConsumptionEvent`: added `price: Double?` (optional, default nil).
- `UserProfile`: added `currency: String` (default `"USD"`).

**Alcohol units formula** (flagged for hand-verification):
`units = volumeMl × count × abv / 10`
Equivalent to the standard `ml × abv% / 1000`. Example: 568 ml × 0.05 / 10 = 2.84 units (pint of 5% beer).

### Key decisions
- Predefined drink types are **static Swift data**, not SwiftData rows. `DrinkTemplate` in SwiftData is reserved for user-created custom templates (future feature).
- The `DrinkCategory` enum IS stored on `ConsumptionEvent`, so old entries can always be recognized and edited by their category.
- `dismissSheet` custom `@Entry` environment value propagates the sheet-level `dismiss` action into pushed NavigationStack destinations without prop drilling.
- Save/Cancel buttons: **top toolbar** (Cancel leading, Save trailing) — iOS HIG standard for modal forms.
- Currency field added to `UserProfile` for future Settings integration; hardcoded to `"USD"` for now in the price row UI.

### Open / next steps
- Settings screen: ABV picker precision (0.1% or 0.5%), currency selection, guideline profile.
- History screen: list of ConsumptionEvents grouped by day.
- Dashboard: weekly progress bar vs guideline.
- Localization string catalog (en + pl).
- Edit existing ConsumptionEvent flow.

---

## 2026-05-16 16:10 — History screen

### What was built

`Features/History/HistoryView.swift` — replaces the placeholder with a fully functional history list.

- `@Query(sort: \ConsumptionEvent.timestamp, order: .reverse)` fetches all events, most recent first.
- Events are grouped by calendar day into `[(day: Date, events: [ConsumptionEvent])]` via `Dictionary(grouping:)`.
- Day section headers: "Today" / "Yesterday" / abbreviated date (e.g. "Fri, 16 May 2026").
- `EventRow` shows: SF Symbol icon (tinted), drink name, subtitle (`568 ml · 5.0% · 14:32`), alcohol units right-aligned.
- Swipe-to-delete per section via `.onDelete`.
- `ContentUnavailableView` empty state when no events exist.
- Full `accessibilityLabel` on each row combining name, volume, ABV%, units, and time.
- Two previews: "With data" (three pre-inserted mock events) and "Empty state".

### Key decisions

- Used `@Query` directly in the view — ADR 0003 explicitly allows this for simple read-only list views; no viewmodel or repository needed for a fetch-and-display pattern.
- `alcoholUnits` in `EventRow` uses the same `volumeMl * abv / 10` formula as `DrinkDetailInputView`. `volumeMl` on the stored event already includes the × count multiplier applied at save time.
- Empty state uses `ContentUnavailableView` (iOS 17+, fine for iOS 26 minimum target).

### Open / next steps

- Dashboard screen: weekly progress bar vs GuidelineProfile threshold, today's total units.
- Settings screen: unblocks ABV precision, currency, guideline choice, UserProfile seeding.
- Edit existing ConsumptionEvent flow.
- Localization string catalog (en + pl).

## 2026-05-16 17:30 — UI polish, i18n, and navigation title experiment

### What was built / changed

- **DrinkDetailInputView pickers**: Volume takes remaining width (`maxWidth: .infinity`); ABV fixed at 88pt, count at 60pt. All picker items use `.callout` font (16pt) for a tighter layout.
- **DrinkTypeTile**: Added `.multilineTextAlignment(.center)`, `.minimumScaleFactor(0.75)`, `.lineLimit(2)` to prevent truncation on longer category names (e.g. "Champagne").
- **Localizable.xcstrings**: Full i18n catalog with 20 dot-notation keys (en/de/pl). All Swift call sites updated. Duplicates (`"Add Drink"` / `"Add drink"`) merged into `addDrink.title`. Literal-style keys converted to `namespace.camelCase`.
- **Navigation title experiment**: Tried `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)` with a leading `ToolbarItem` for a left-aligned title. iOS treats all toolbar items as interactive and the area clips — left `.inline` per user preference on Dashboard and History.

### Key decisions

- Fixed widths for ABV and count pickers rather than proportional layout — simpler, no `GeometryReader` needed, values are stable across device sizes.
- `.minimumScaleFactor` + `.lineLimit(2)` preferred over removing the tile's `aspectRatio` — keeps the grid visually uniform.
- Left-aligned inline nav title is not achievable cleanly in SwiftUI without UIKit; `.inline` kept but title stays centered as per iOS system behavior.
- i18n keys: literal strings with `+`, `()`, or spaces converted to dot-notation. `"Cancel"` / `"Save"` → `action.cancel` / `action.save` for consistency.

### Open / next steps

- Dashboard screen (recommended next).
- Settings screen (unblocks currency, ABV precision, UserProfile seeding).
- Add `Localizable.xcstrings` to Xcode project target (user must do this in Xcode — file exists on disk but is not yet in `.xcodeproj`).

## 2026-05-17 12:30 — Bugfixes: Settings loading, unit formulas, overflow rings

### What was fixed

**SwiftData migration crash (ProgressView loop in Settings)**
`abvPrecisionPermille` and `alcoholUnit` were declared without inline property defaults (`var x: T` instead of `var x: T = default`). SwiftData lightweight migration uses the inline default to populate new columns for existing rows — without it, the schema migration silently failed and `@Query<UserProfile>` returned empty. Fixed by adding `= 5` and `= AlcoholUnit.units` at the property declaration level. Note: SwiftData's `@Model` macro requires fully qualified names here (`AlcoholUnit.units`, not `.units`).

**Seeding race condition removed**
Moved `UserProfile` seeding from `ContentView.onAppear` into the `ModelContainer` stored property initializer in `drinkpulseApp`. The old approach had a timing window where `SettingsView` could appear before the seed ran. The new approach seeds synchronously before any view is created.

**`AlcoholUnit.units` formula now guideline-aware**
The `.units` case was hardcoded to the UK formula (`/ 7.89`) regardless of the selected guideline. Fixed to use the correct regional threshold: DE/WHO/custom → 10 g/unit, UK → 7.89 g/unit (10 ml ethanol), US → 14 g/unit. Display precision changed from `%.2f` to `%.1f`.

**Dashboard overflow rings (> 100%)**
Removed the `min(..., 1.0)` cap on `IntakeRing.progress`. Added a second arc (lineWidth 6, red 55% opacity) that draws the overflow portion as a second lap on top of the full primary arc. The center percentage text now shows the real value (150%, 200%, etc.).

**ContentView preview seeding**
The `#Preview` used `.modelContainer(for:inMemory:)` which creates an empty store — `SettingsView` showed `ProgressView` forever in Xcode Previews. Fixed by using an explicit `ModelContainer` with `UserProfile.preview` inserted before rendering.

### Key decisions

- Inline defaults on `@Model` stored properties are the correct pattern for SwiftData lightweight migration; `init` parameter defaults are insufficient.
- The `AlcoholUnit.standardDrinks` option remains useful for UK users who want the WHO 10 g threshold instead of the native UK 7.89 g unit.
- Overflow visual: a thinner concentric arc (rather than a color flash or badge) keeps the ring metaphor consistent and scales to arbitrary multiples.

## 2026-05-17 10:30 — Alcohol display unit setting

### What was built

New user preference: **Alcohol unit** — controls how consumed alcohol is displayed everywhere in the app.

**Three options** (Settings → Preferences → Alcohol unit):
| Option | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Grams (g) | `pureAlcoholGrams` | 22.4 g |
| Units (UK) | `pureAlcoholGrams / 7.89` | 2.84 units |
| Standard drinks | `pureAlcoholGrams / 10` (or `/14` for US guideline) | 2.24 std |

**Formulas — pending hand-verification:**
- Units: derived from existing `volumeMl × abv / 10` formula via `pureAlcoholGrams = volumeMl × abv × 0.789`, giving `units = pureAlcoholGrams / 7.89`.
- Standard drinks: 14g per drink for US guideline (NIAAA), 10g for WHO / DE / UK. Standard drink threshold depends on `UserProfile.guidelineChoice`.

**Changed views:**
- `HistoryView` `EventRow` — right column shows value + unit label from `AlcoholUnit.formattedValue/unitLabel`
- `DashboardView` `IntakeRing` — secondary center text (below %) shows preferred unit; percentage calculation stays grams-vs-grams
- `DrinkDetailInputView` — alcohol readout row label and value both driven by `AlcoholUnit.displayName/formattedValue`

**Domain change** (`UserProfile`): `alcoholUnit: AlcoholUnit` added (default `.units`). SwiftData lightweight migration.

**i18n**: 7 new keys (`settings.alcoholUnit`, `settings.alcoholUnit.*`, `unit.g`, `unit.units`, `unit.standardDrinks`). Existing `history.units` key replaced by `unit.units` in the views.

### Key decisions

- `AlcoholUnit` extension with `formattedValue(_:guideline:)` lives on the enum in `UserProfile.swift` — tightly coupled to domain, not a `@Model` method.
- `IntakeRing` receives a pre-formatted `consumedLabel: String` string from the parent rather than owning the conversion logic — keeps the struct a pure display component.
- `DrinkDetailInputView` now uses `pureAlcoholGrams` directly (was computing `alcoholUnits` via `volumeMl × abv / 10`). Both yield the same displayed value when unit = `.units` since `pureAlcoholGrams / 7.89 ≡ volumeMl × abv / 10`.

### Open / next steps

- Hand-verify the unit conversion formulas.
- Volume unit display wiring (History, AddDrink picker labels).
- Edit existing ConsumptionEvent flow.

## 2026-05-17 09:00 — Settings screen

### What was built

**`Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift`** — replaces placeholder with a three-section `Form`:

1. **Profile** — Biological sex (`Picker`), Age (`Stepper` 13–120)
2. **Guideline** — inline `Picker` showing WHO / DE / UK / US with daily+weekly threshold subtitles; `custom` case filtered out (requires its own flow)
3. **Preferences** — Volume unit (`Picker`: ml / US fl oz / Imperial fl oz), ABV precision (segmented: 0.5 % or 0.1 % steps)

No separate ViewModel — `UserProfile` is `@Observable` via `@Model`, so `SettingsForm` takes `@Bindable var profile` and changes auto-persist via SwiftData.

**Domain changes** (`UserProfile.swift`):
- `UnitSystem` enum: added `.usCustomary` case (raw: "usCustomary"), kept `.metric` and `.imperial` raw values for backward compat.
- `abvPrecisionPermille: Int` — new field (default 5). SwiftData lightweight migration adds the column automatically.

**First-launch seeding** (`drinkpulseApp.swift`): `seedDefaultsIfNeeded(in:)` called in `WindowGroup.onAppear` inserts `UserProfile()` if the store is empty. Keeps bootstrap logic out of views.

**ABV precision wired** (`DrinkDetailInputView.swift`): Reads `abvPrecisionPermille` from the profile via `@Query`. `displayedAbvValues` is regenerated from the preset's `abvMin`/`abvMax` (new computed properties on `DrinkTypePreset`) at the user-selected step. `safeAbvIndex` clamps the selection to the current array length.

**i18n**: 18 new `settings.*` keys (en/de/pl); `settings.placeholder` removed.

### Key decisions

- Inline guideline picker (`.pickerStyle(.inline)`) chosen over `.navigationLink` to show all 4 options with threshold subtitles in one view — avoids a push just to pick one of four options.
- Threshold summary strings ("20 g/day · 100 g/week") are hardcoded in the view extension — they're display-layer facts that don't need localization for the initial release.
- ABV precision uses `.segmented` style (2 options, always visible, no push needed).
- Volume unit label strings live in xcstrings; `%` characters in DE/PL translations reworded to avoid Xcode format-specifier false positives (`%-S` parse error on `%-Schritte`).

### Open / next steps

- Volume unit wiring in display layer (History rows, picker labels in AddDrink).
- Edit existing `ConsumptionEvent`.
- First-launch onboarding to guide the user through Settings on fresh install.

## 2026-05-17 07:40 — SwiftUI expert review fixes

### What was changed

Applied four correctness fixes flagged in the expert code review:

1. **`ForEach` identity** (`DrinkDetailInputView`): replaced `ForEach(preset.volumes.indices, id: \.self)` and `ForEach(preset.abvValues.indices, id: \.self)` with `ForEach(Array(...enumerated()), id: \.offset)`. `.indices` is an anti-pattern for dynamic content — array mutations can shift indices causing SwiftUI to diff incorrectly.

2. **Price locale bug** (`DrinkDetailInputView`): `Double(priceText)` returns nil for European decimal formats like "1,5". Added `parsedPrice` computed property that normalises comma → period before parsing.

3. **Emoji accessibility** (`DrinkTypeGridView`): added `.accessibilityHidden(true)` to the `Text(preset.icon)` emoji. The wrapping `NavigationLink` already carries `.accessibilityLabel(preset.name)`; without hiding the emoji, VoiceOver would read both the emoji description and the label.

4. **Midnight `@Query` refresh** (`DashboardView`): removed the custom `init()` that baked the 31-day cutoff into a `#Predicate` at view creation time — this cutoff never refreshed if the app stayed open past midnight. Now fetches all events with a plain `@Query`, filters in-memory using `@State private var now`, and updates `now` via `.onChange(of: scenePhase)` whenever the app returns to the foreground.

### Key decisions

- Fetching all `ConsumptionEvent` rows (no predicate) is acceptable for a personal tracking app where the total row count is small. Avoids the complexity of re-creating a `@Query` at runtime.
- `thirtyDayGrams` now explicitly filters for `-30 days` instead of relying on being "all events in the last 31 days" from the old predicate — semantically cleaner.

### Open / next steps

- Settings screen (highest priority).

---

## 2026-05-16 18:30 — Dashboard intake rings

### What was built

`DashboardView` replaces the "Coming soon" placeholder with three circular progress rings:
- **Today** — grams consumed today vs `dailyLimitGrams`
- **7 days** — grams in last 7 days vs `weeklyLimitGrams`
- **30 days** — grams in last 31 days vs `weeklyLimitGrams × (30/7)`

`IntakeRing` (private struct in DashboardView.swift): custom `Circle().trim` arc, color-coded green/orange/red at 70% and 100% thresholds, shows percentage and raw grams in centre, accessible via combined `accessibilityLabel`.

`@Query` with `#Predicate` filters events to last 31 days at init time; today and 7-day windows computed in-memory. Three new i18n keys added (`dashboard.ring.today`, `dashboard.ring.days7`, `dashboard.ring.days30`).

### Key decisions

- Custom `Circle().trim` over `Gauge(.accessoryCircularCapacity)` — the gauge style is unreliable outside widget contexts on iOS.
- 30-day limit derived as `weeklyLimit × (30/7)` — no official monthly guideline exists; this is a proportional approximation, labelled "30 days" not "monthly norm".
- Limits read from `UserProfile` with WHO fallback (20g daily / 100g weekly) since UserProfile seeding is still an open question. Dashboard remains functional without a seeded profile.
- UK guideline has `dailyLimitGrams = 0` (no daily limit stated). Ring shows "—" and no arc for that case.

### Open / next steps

- Settings screen: seeds UserProfile, lets user pick guideline — directly affects ring accuracy.
- UserProfile first-launch seeding (currently rings silently fall back to WHO defaults).
- `Localizable.xcstrings` still needs adding to Xcode project target.
